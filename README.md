Project Name: Unity in Diversity

This is a project aiming at connecting language learners and fluent speakers together. We wish to help them connect through cultural and interest differences instead of similarities.

We use Python as back-end language and HTML as front-end language.
Machine learning tool: IBM Watson Studio Machine Learning Service
