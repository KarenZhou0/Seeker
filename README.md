Project Name: Unity in Diversity

This is a project aiming at connecting language learners and fluent speakers together. We wish to help them connect through cultural and interest differences instead of similarities.

We use Python as back-end language and Create React App as front-end tool.
Machine learning tool: IBM Watson Studio Machine Learning Service
